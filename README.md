# Automated Customer Issue Categorization and Resolution System

### Overview
This project is designed to build an **Automated System** that assists customers in resolving simple, recurring issues without the need for human intervention. The system automatically categorizes customer inquiries into predefined categories and instantly provides appropriate solutions, helping customers resolve their problems independently and efficiently.

### **Problem Statement**
Customers often encounter simple, recurring issues that could be resolved without manual support. However, current processes require human intervention, leading to unnecessary delays and higher resource utilization. This project aims to automate the process of resolving common customer queries by:
- Categorizing customer issues into predefined categories
- Providing automated solutions based on the categorized issue
- Reducing dependency on human support for frequently occurring problems

### **Project Objectives**
- Develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based solution that can **automatically classify customer queries** into relevant issue categories.
- Provide **instant automated responses** with solutions, based on the identified category.
- Enable **self-service** for customers, reducing the burden on customer support teams and improving response times.

### **Key Features**
- **Customer Query Categorization**: Automatically identifies the category of a customer query (e.g., account issues, transactions, loans, credit card issues).
- **Automated Response Generation**: Instantly provides customers with the right solution based on the categorized issue.
- **Support for Multiple Themes**: The system is flexible enough to handle various themes like:
  - Account Issues
  - Transactions
  - Credit/Debit Cards
  - Loans
  - Online Banking, and more.
  
### **Sample Use Case**
A customer asks: **"How do I change my address in my account?"**  
The system recognizes that this question relates to **personal information updates** and provides an automated response detailing the steps the customer needs to follow to update their address.

### **Data Collection**
To train the system, we are working with sample **FAQ data** representing common banking queries. Here are a few categories:
- **Account Issues**: Queries related to account opening, closing, or personal information updates.
- **Transactions**: Questions about transfers, withdrawals, and transaction limits.
- **Loans**: Queries on loan applications, repayments, interest rates, etc.
- **Credit/Debit Cards**: Issues related to card activation, blocking, and limits.
- **Online Banking**: Problems with online banking platforms, passwords, and login issues.

### **Data Preparation**
1. **FAQ Dataset**: A list of commonly asked questions and predefined categories. (See `data/faq_data.csv` for sample queries).
2. **Query Variations**: Each predefined question comes with multiple possible phrasings to train the model effectively.

### **Model Workflow**

The project has two levels of logic to balance computational efficiency and performance:

#### **Logic (Basic)(refer to logic.ipynb)**
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, tokenize, and vectorize customer queries.
2. **Model Training**: Use a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model to classify customer queries into predefined categories. This approach is used initially to reduce computational power requirements while maintaining satisfactory accuracy.
3. **Response Generation**: Once categorized, the system selects the appropriate response and sends it back to the customer.

#### **Advanced Logic (refer to advanced_logic.ipynb)**
1. **Enhanced Model Training**: For higher accuracy, the **BERT** model is used to capture the complex structure and nuances in customer queries, providing more accurate categorization for recurring customer issues.
2. **Real-time API (Optional)**: An API can be built for integration with live systems, allowing the system to receive queries and respond instantly.
